**Adversarial Diffusion And Probabilistic Transformer-Graph Fraud Detection**

---

## 🔍 Overview  
**ADAPT-Fraud** is a novel fraud detection framework designed for **evolving, stealthy, and adversarial financial fraud patterns**.  
It combines **adversarial data augmentation**, **diffusion-based fraud pattern synthesis**, and a **probabilistic Transformer–Graph Neural Network (GNN) detector** to achieve robust, uncertainty-aware fraud detection in transactional networks.

Traditional fraud detection systems often fail when fraudsters modify their patterns to evade static, deterministic models.  
ADAPT-Fraud addresses this by **continuously generating new, hard-to-detect fraud samples** and training an **uncertainty-aware, hybrid Transformer-GNN** to remain resilient under adversarial conditions.

## 🧠 Key Innovations  

1. **Adversarial Diffusion-based Fraud Simulation**  
   - Uses a **conditional diffusion model** to synthesize realistic, stealthy fraudulent transactions.  
   - Trains against the detector in an adversarial loop, forcing it to learn from increasingly difficult examples.  

2. **Probabilistic Transformer-GNN Detector**  
   - Extracts temporal patterns with a **Temporal Transformer Encoder**.  
   - Models relational structures in transaction graphs via a **Graph Neural Network**.  
   - Incorporates **Bayesian/uncertainty modeling** to output both fraud likelihood and model confidence.  

3. **Adaptive Curriculum Training**  
   - Starts with simple fraud examples → progressively introduces complex, stealthy, and adversarial ones.  
   - Automatically adjusts fraud generation difficulty based on the detector’s performance.  

4. **Risk-aware Decision Making**  
   - Low-uncertainty fraud predictions → direct automated blocking.  
   - High-uncertainty cases → human analyst review.

## 📜 Methodology  

### 1. Data Representation
- **Nodes**: Accounts, merchants, devices.  
- **Edges**: Transactions between nodes, with attributes (amount, time, location, payment type, etc.).  
- **Temporal Features**: Encoded sequences of transactions for each account.  

### 2. Adversarial Diffusion Fraud Generator
- **Goal**: Learn to generate fraud patterns that appear legitimate but still capture malicious traits.  
- **Architecture**: Conditional Diffusion Model conditioned on transaction features + fraud label.  
- **Adversarial Objective**: Minimize detectability by the current detector model.  

### 3. Probabilistic Transformer-GNN Fraud Detector
- **Step 1: Temporal Encoding**  
  - **Transformer encoder** processes sequential transaction histories to capture temporal dependencies.  
- **Step 2: Relational Graph Modeling**  
  - **Graph Neural Network** captures relationships between accounts/transactions to detect collusive behaviors.  
- **Step 3: Probabilistic Output Layer**  
  - **Monte Carlo Dropout** or **Bayesian Neural Layers** produce fraud probability + uncertainty score.  

### 4. Training Loop
```plaintext
for each training iteration:
    1. Generate synthetic fraud patterns using diffusion model.
    2. Merge with real fraud & legitimate transactions.
    3. Train probabilistic Transformer-GNN to classify fraud & estimate uncertainty.
    4. Evaluate on adversarial examples.
    5. Increase generator difficulty if detector performance improves.

Algorithmic Components
Diffusion Loss:
Encourages generated fraud patterns to remain realistic while being challenging to detect.

Adversarial Training Loss:
Minimizes the detector’s accuracy on synthetic fraud while maximizing overall detection performance.

Classification + Uncertainty Loss:
Combines cross-entropy with uncertainty calibration losses (e.g., negative log-likelihood).

Curriculum Scheduler:
Dynamically increases generator difficulty as detector improves.

🚀 Applications
Banking & Fintech — Detect evolving payment fraud, account takeover, and money laundering.

E-commerce — Prevent collusive merchant fraud and synthetic identity scams.

Telecom — Stop SIM-swap and call-forwarding fraud.

📈 Advantages
Resists data drift by constantly training on fresh adversarial patterns.

Outputs fraud probability + confidence, enabling better risk management.

Captures both temporal and relational fraud indicators.

🧮 Possible Extensions
Incorporating Graph Transformers for unified temporal-relational modeling.

Adding explainability modules (e.g., SHAP over GNN + Transformer embeddings).

Leveraging federated training for cross-bank fraud detection without data sharing.
